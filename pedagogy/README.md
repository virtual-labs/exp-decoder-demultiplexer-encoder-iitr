#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
This experiment contains Decoder/de-multiplexer and encoder. The user can verify the outputs at all possible combination of inputs for each gate respectively. The user can also verify its truth table for each circuit by checking the combinations entered by the user.
